Package pp provides a pretty-printer for Go types. It produces a lightweight, Go-syntax-like output.  It elides some type information and syntactic details.  The intent is to show a data structure, such as an abstract syntax tree, without much clutter.  It also supports printing to the dot language of graphviz!
